Team4 mini-reports


2022/09/23

What was done this week?
This week our group started building the groundwork for our subsystem, i. e. we discussed what exactly we will be making and
what kind of programming tools we will be using, after which began composing a requirements specification document. The work
was divided correspondingly within the team, and a rough draft was prepared, which will be uploaded at late Thursday.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
At the moment, our main issue is lack of sense of direction, we find it difficult to determine the first steps in this project,
since none of us have any similar experience. Another obstacle is time management, this week we pushed our tasks to the end of
the work week, which meant little time was spent reflecting on the task. Furthermore, we noticed that quite a number of students
from other teams were still missing from our project group in Teams, meaning there was little communication between teams 1, 3
and 5.

What is the goal for next week?
Next week we plan on preparing a polished version of the requirements specification document and proceeding to the next
task. Hopefully, we can also add everyone to the Teams group and get atleast a rough estimate what we will be
receiving from team 3 and what team 5 expects from us.

What is the overall status?
GREEN.


2022/09/30

What was done this week?
This week we made some improvements in our requirements specification document. We remade it according to the LaTex template,
fixed some flaws and improved the implementation plan. Together with other groups we agreed on using Java.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We had issues working with latex, we couldn't get it to work at all, which means we remade the document with the pdf file of
the template. We are also unsure how to divide the work of area 3 between the groups.

What is the goal for next week?
Our main goals will be improving the implementation plan and finishing the requirements specification document.

What is the overall status?
GREEN.


2022/10/07

What was done this week?
This week, we finally got the provided LaTex template to work and prepared the requirements specification document using it.
Afterwards, our team arranged a meeting in which we worked on some unfinished parts of the document, mainly the non-functional 
requirements part and the implementation plan. After that, the SRS was finished and submitted for grading.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
This week, planned on having a meeting for team leaders, however we were unable to do so. Unfortunately, that means that we
do not know the exact details of what each team is responsible for and we are not sure what we are planning to doi with area 3.

What is the goal for next week?
The main goal next week is to finally hold a team leader meeting. Besides that, we are also planning on starting to work on 
the technical specification.

What is the overall status?
GREEN.


2022/10/14

What was done this week?
This week we focused on planning and communication. The teams leaders got together to discuss certain aspects of the project and
the plan for area 3. Afterwards, we agreed to change the communication platform for the whole project from Teams to Discord.
Lastly, we also got the json file of area 1 and started researching information about the technical specification.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We are still lackinging ideas about what to do with area 3, therefore we are delaying working on it until later.

What is the goal for next week?
We plan to continue working on technical specification and start building the first version of the software's code.

What is the overall status?
GREEN.


2022/10/21

What was done this week?
This week we worked on making the diagrams for the technical specification and began working on the software. We also started
working with JIRA, as well and spent some time analysing the area 1 JSON file and figuring out what kind of data for us is
crucial and what we do not actually need.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We had some issues analysing the JSON file, since it might be a bit too complicated and encountered some trouble working with
JIRA, specifically - github intergration for JIRA.

What is the goal for next week?
Continue work on our part and prepare a draft of the technical specification.

What is the overall status?
GREEN.


2022/10/28

What was done this week?
This week we focused on technical specification. What we worked on: 
we created a context diagram,
created UML Deployment, Activity, Use Case diagrams,
worked on the logic behind the software,
made a list of tools that we are going to use.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
The issues that we encountered are:
we're not sure if the diagrams that we made are done correctly,
in some parts of the document, we're not sure if we are writing it correctly,
we still haven't done the parts about dinamic aspects and testing.

What is the goal for next week?
Finish the technical specification document, make progress on the software.

What is the overall status?
GREEN/YELLOW.


2022/11/04

What was done this week?
This week our team made significant progress. Most importantly, we finished and submitted the technical specification document.
Furthermore, we also started coding. What we have by now is a program that calculates the mean height of the roof, the wind
pressure zone width and finds the point coordinates of the wind pressure zones of a simple gable roof.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We still need to implement data reading from the JSON, need to look into zone calculation for roof faces that
are different shapes (that aren't rectangles) and we need to figure out how we are going to send output.

Goals for next week.
Continue work on the software, start preparing for the upcoming presentation.

What is the overall status?
GREEN


2022/11/11

What was done?
This week we mostly progressed on the software itself. Most importantly, we implemented code to read the JSON file
and started pushing the code to GitHub. Furthermore, we got in contact with lecturer Gediminas and discussed the
logic behind how the software should work and how it should be tested.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We are having trouble figuring out the logic behind working with triangle shaped roof faces. We need to expand our
testing.

Goals for next week:
1. Work on the logic.
2. Continue work on the software.
3. Prepare the presentation.
   
Status: GREEN/YELLOW


2022/11/18

What was done?
This week we prepared our part of the mid-term project presentation. In order to achieve that, we held a team leader meeting
and a meeting of our team members as well. Nevertheless, we also made some progress on the software and its testing.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
We had trouble communicating between teams and getting everyone to send their parts. Concequentally, the project
presentation was finished late in the week and thus, there was little time to prepare the speech.

Goals for next week:
Start implementing support for different roof face types in the software. 
   
Status: GREEN


2022/11/25

What was done?
This week we had a short meeting between area 2, 4 and 5 about merging of the project areas. Afterwards, we proceeded to merge
area 4 with area 2.

What issues/risks/blockers do you have?
There were some issues while merging the areas, which took us some time to fix.

Goals for next week:
Implement functionalities to support complex roof types, look into merging of other areas.

Status: GREEN


2022/12/02

What was done?
Documented logic behind the software, so that everyone in our team can understand it easier.
Fixed some conflicts between area 2 and 4.
   
What issues/risks/blockers did we face?
Issues implementing the logic.
   
Goals for next week:
Try working with data of different roof types.
Start remaking official documentation.
   
Status: YELLOW


2022/12/09

What was done?
Started remaking official documentation.
Fixed some code issues and continued software development.

What issues/risks/blockers did we face?
After more testing, we found that some parts of the implementation logic were flawed and had to be rewritten.

Goals for next week:
Try to finish coding.
Implement more automated tests.
Finish remaking official documentation.

Status: YELLOW


2022/12/16

What was done?
Finished rewriting official documentation.
Worked with Area5 to make sure our results can be presented visually.
Advanced a lot in implementing logic for other roof types.

What issues/risks/blockers did we face?
There were some issues displaying level 2 zones visually, there are several solutions to this problem and we are still trying
to decide what is the best choice.

Goals for next week:
Finish recreating diagrams.
Finish coding and debugging.
More testing.
Finish final project presentation.

Status: GREEN/YELLOW
