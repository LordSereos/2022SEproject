TEAM2 mini-reports

2022/09/23

  1) What was done?
We had a team meeting on Wednesday discussing the content of the Requirement Specification. 
We made notes what should we write about and what is the purpose of it. After that each of us
wrote a particular part of the Requirements Specification and team leader will have the draft published
by Thursday night. We started discussing what kind of software will we use and how we will get the
result, however we didn't really think of anything specific.
  
  2)What issues/blockers did we face?
We postponed the meeting that we eventually had on Wednesday for 2 times - some students were unable to
come to university on Monday or Tuesday and we didn't really want to have a meeting online. We also
realised that we don't know who will be in TEAM3 so it's not clear to whom we need to talk in order to
know what we will need to create.
  
  3)Goal for next week:
*Finish the Requirements Specification;
*Create an understanding of which tools will we use;
*Distribute our roles in creating software;
*Ideally it would be great to undestand what kind of information we will receive from TEAM1 and in what
appearance it should be delivered to TEAM3;

  1) What was done?
*We finished the content of our Requirement Specifications. Fixed issues we had last week and added more
content. Started writing it in Latex. 
*We talked with other teams and created a mutual agreement of working with Java, so it is easier to merge
code and parse results between teams.
*We decided that we will create an API to implement our task.
*We talked to TEAM1 and asked them to give us a JSON file as their result.
*We had a particular success in distributing our jobs during the creation of Requirement Specification - 
everyone successfully finished their responsibility and we managed to finish everything a week before deadline
(maybe not complete Latex part)
  
  2) What issues/blockers did we face?
*Deciding what we want to build.
*Communicating with everyone and mutually agreeing that we are all working with Java.
*Converting our Specification into Latex :) Was the hardest problem so far
  
  3) Goal for next week:
*Finish (if not yet) converting Specification document into Latex
*Deciding what exactly we need in a JSON file from TEAM1
*Generate ideas on how we will split TEAM3 work
